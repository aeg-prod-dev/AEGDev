# AEGDev

This is a README:

  This repo will contain the media assets and credentials for the AEG .com e-commerce site 
  hosted via squarespace. A separate repo will be created for the AEG .net static 
  site.
  
  
  Start by uploading your folders of media labeled with {Product_Category}/{Vendor_Name}/{Product_Name}
  Once the first file is uploaded, products of the same {Product_Category} will fall into
  the same directory. 
  
  Make sure you separate the files based on categories, and within each category we will be separating
  the products by Vendor.
